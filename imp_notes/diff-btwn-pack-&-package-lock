## package.json vs. package-lock.json

**package.json** and **package-lock.json** are both configuration files used in Node.js projects. They serve different purposes, but work together to manage project dependencies.

### package.json
* **Purpose:** Defines the project's metadata and dependencies.
* **Contents:**
  - **name:** Project name.
  - **version:** Project version.
  - **description:** Brief project description.
  - **keywords:** Keywords for search.
  - **author:** Project author information.
  - **license:** Project license.
  - **dependencies:** List of dependencies required by the project.
  - **devDependencies:** List of dependencies needed for development but not production.
  - **scripts:** Scripts to automate tasks like testing, building, and starting the server.

* **Usage:**
  - Manually edited to declare dependencies and project information.
  - Used by package managers like npm and yarn to install dependencies.

### package-lock.json
* **Purpose:** Stores the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies that were installed.
* **Contents:**
  - Detailed information about installed dependencies, including their versions, hashes, and dependencies.
* **Usage:**
  - Automatically generated by package managers when installing dependencies.
  - Ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments.
  - Prevents unexpected behavior due to dependency version conflicts.

**In summary:**

* **package.json** specifies the desired dependencies and project metadata.
* **package-lock.json** records the actual versions of dependencies installed, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

**When working with a Node.js project:**

* **Modify package.json** to add or remove dependencies.
* **Run a package manager command** (e.g., `npm install`) to install dependencies based on package.json.
* **package-lock.json** will be updated automatically to reflect the installed versions.

By understanding the roles of these two files, you can effectively manage dependencies in your Node.js projects and ensure consistent development environments.
